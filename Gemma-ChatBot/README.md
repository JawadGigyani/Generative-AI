# Generative AI Chatbot Project using Gemma Model

This project demonstrates the creation of a generative AI chatbot using the [google/gemma-2b-it](https://huggingface.co/google/gemma-2b-it) from Hugging Face's Transformers library. The chatbot is capable of generating responses based on user input, leveraging a powerful language model.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to showcase the capabilities of the Gemma model in generating human-like text responses for given inputs, and to deploy the chatbot using Streamlit for an interactive user interface.
